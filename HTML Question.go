1. What is HTML?

inventor of HTML Tim Berners-Lee.
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the language used to create the structure of web pages, defining elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more.
HTML uses tags enclosed in angle brackets (< >) to define elements, e.g., <h1> for headings or <p> for paragraphs.
üåê for Headings -> h1 to h6 1 has high priority
üåê p->Paragraphs
üåê link->Links
üåê img->Images
üåê Tables
üåê Forms
It works alongside CSS (for styling) and JavaScript (for interactivity) to build complete web pages.

An element is a complete structure in HTML, including tags and content, like <p>This is a paragraph.</p>. An attribute adds extra information to an element, such as href in <a href="https://example.com">Link</a>. A tag is the part of an element enclosed in angle brackets, like <h1> or </h1>. A property is a CSS style rule defining an elements appearance or behavior, like color: red;.

HTML tags are used to create the structure and content of web pages. Each tag serves a specific purpose and helps organize the content, making it readable for both browsers and developers.


<meta charset="UTF-8"> unicode transformation format 

Here's how it works in detail:
UTF-8 Encoding:

UTF-8 is a variable-length character encoding. It can represent characters from the entire Unicode character set. This includes everything from ASCII characters (like A, B, C, etc.) to characters from other languages (like √©, √±, Êàë), and even emojis (like üòä).
UTF-8 uses 1 to 4 bytes to represent a character, which allows it to cover a very wide range of characters.
Browser‚Äôs Role:

When the browser reads the document, it looks at the <meta charset="UTF-8"> tag to understand how to decode the file's bytes.
If the file contains non-ASCII characters (such as accented characters or symbols), the browser uses UTF-8 to interpret these characters and display them correctly.
Without UTF-8 (or Incorrect Encoding):

If you don‚Äôt specify the correct character encoding, or if there‚Äôs an encoding mismatch, the browser might not interpret the bytes correctly. This could result in garbled or broken characters (like question marks or strange symbols) instead of the intended characters.

In Summary:
UTF-8 is used to encode the characters in an HTML page (or any text file) so that the browser can understand and display them correctly.
When a webpage is served to the browser, the text (including special characters) is encoded using UTF-8, ensuring that the browser can decode and display the correct characters on the screen.



2. How to insert an image in HTML?
<img> tag is used to add an image in a web page.
Images are not inserted into a web page basically they are linked to web pages. The <img> tag helps to create a holding space for the referenced image.

The <img> tag is normally empty, it has attributes only, and does not have a closing tag. this type called void tag

 <img> tag has two required parameters:

src ‚Äì The path to the image
alt ‚Äì An alternate text for the image

<img src="image path" alt="Italian Trulli">
<img src="demo.jpg" alt="Italian Trulli">

3. How to set background image in HTML?

the CSS background-image property:
<div style="background-image: url('img_boy.jpg');">

4. How to comment in HTML?
Normally HTML comments are not being displayed in the browser. But these comments can help to document the HTML source code.

<!‚Äì Write your comments here ‚Äì>

5. `How to give space in HTML?`
In order to add a space in the webpage, Go  where you want to add the space and then use the spacebar. Normally, HTML displays one space between words, no matter how many times you have entered  the space bar. 

Now if you Type &nbsp; to force an extra space. 

This is known as a non-breaking space because it helps to prevent a line break at its location.

6.`How to link CSS to HTML?`

Types of CSS:

So there are three ways to add CSS to HTML documents :

16. What is dom in HTML?


DOM stands for Document Object Model. When a web page is getting loaded that time the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page and it is constructed as a tree of Objects. HTML DOM is basically an Object Model for HTML

The DOM (Document Object Model) in HTML is a programming interface that represents the structure of an HTML document as a tree-like hierarchy. It allows developers to access, manipulate, and modify the content, structure, and styles of a webpage dynamically using JavaScript or other programming languages.

Key Points:
The DOM treats each element, attribute, and piece of content in the HTML document as an object or node.
It creates a tree-like structure where:
The root node is the <html> element.
Child nodes include <head>, <body>, and other nested elements.



18. How to create form in HTML?

check Form.html

Features of the Form:
Text Input: Name, email, and password fields with placeholders.
Radio Buttons: To select gender (only one option can be chosen).
Checkboxes: For hobbies (multiple options can be selected).
Dropdown Menu: To select the country.
Buttons:
Submit: Sends the form data to the specified action URL.
Reset: Clears all inputs in the form.

In HTML, a label is an element used to define a user-readable description for form controls, such as input fields, checkboxes, and radio buttons. It improves accessibility and makes the form easier to use, especially for screen readers.

Key Features:
The <label> element is associated with a specific form control via the for attribute.
The for attribute matches the id of the form control, linking the label to that element.
When you click on the label, it focuses the associated form control (e.g., clicking a label for a text box will focus the input field).

19. How to create button in HTML?
<button type="button">Click Here!</button>
 < input type='button' />

23. How to use div tag in html to divide the page?

In HTML, the <div> tag is a block-level element used to group and organize content into sections. It does not have any inherent styling, but it is commonly used with CSS to divide and structure a webpage into different sections or layouts.
Block-Level Element: A <div> element occupies the full width of its parent container and creates a new line before and after itself.
Grouping Similar Elements: You can wrap multiple elements inside a <div> to group them together. This helps in structuring the page, and you can apply common styles to the grouped elements.
CSS Application: By using the class or id attributes, you can target the <div> element and apply CSS rules to style the grouped content.

30. Which is better: HTML or HTML5?
HTML5 is the newest version of HTML and it is better than HTML because it includes new features like audio and video elements, new semantic elements, and support for local storage.

31 .Semantic elements in HTML are tags that provide meaning about the content they enclose, making the structure of the web page more descriptive and easier to understand for both developers and machines (like search engines and screen readers).
Improved Accessibility: Helps screen readers and assistive technologies understand the content structure.
SEO (Search Engine Optimization): Search engines use semantic tags to understand the importance and context of the content.
Better Readability and Maintainability: Semantic elements improve the clarity of code, making it easier for developers to understand the page structure.

Explanation:
The <header> contains the main heading and navigation links.
The <main> element encloses the main content of the page, which includes a <section> and an <article>.
The <footer> contains the copyright information.

32. What is span in HTML?
The <span> tag in HTML is an inline element used to group and style a small section of text or other inline elements within a block of content. It doesn't inherently add any styling or structure by itself but serves as a container for applying styles or JavaScript functionality to a specific part of the content.

Key Points about <span>:
Inline Element: Unlike block-level elements like <div>, <span> does not break the flow of content. It stays within the same line as the content around it.
Styling and Grouping: Its often used to apply styles (like color, font-size) or JavaScript functionality to a specific portion of text or content within a larger block.
No Semantics: The <span> tag does not convey any particular meaning about the content it wraps. It's purely used for styling and grouping.

The <span> tag is used to apply the class highlight to part of the text ("highlighted text").
The class is defined in CSS to change the text color to red and make it bold.
The rest of the content (the paragraph) remains unaffected because <span> is an inline element. 


When to Use <span>:
When you need to apply styles or JavaScript actions to a small part of a block of text or content, without affecting the layout of the surrounding content.

34. What is a ‚Äúfieldset‚Äù tag in HTML?
A fieldset is used to group related elements in a form. It is useful for creating structures such as tables or grid layouts.

Explanation:
The <fieldset> tag groups the form fields into two sections: Personal Information and Preferences.
The <legend> tag provides a title for each section to describe its content, making the form more understandable.
The browser automatically adds a border around the grouped fields within the <fieldset>, but you can also customize this with CSS.
When to Use <fieldset>:
Use <fieldset> to group related form elements together, especially when creating complex forms. It helps organize your form content and makes it easier for users to navigate and understand the form's structure.

37. How to add a link in HTML? .
To add links in html we use <a> and </a> tags,  which are the tags used to define the links. The <a> tag indicates where the hyperlink starts and the </a> tag indicates where it ends. Whatever text gets added inside these tags, will work as a hyperlink. Add the URL for the link in the <a href=‚Äù ‚Äù>.

The href (Hypertext Reference) attribute in HTML is used to specify the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) or destination address for an anchor element (<a>). It defines where the link should navigate when clicked.

<b> hey, welcome to great learning!</b>

Semantic Meaning:
<b> is purely for visual styling (no implied importance).
<strong> conveys that the content is of greater importance or has strong emphasis.
Accessibility: <strong> is more beneficial for accessibility because screen readers will typically emphasize the text when reading it aloud, whereas <b> has no such significance.

The first sentence uses <b>, which only makes the text bold visually.
The second sentence uses <strong>, which makes the text bold and indicates that it has strong emphasis or importance.

 What is datalist tag?

 <!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Datalist Example</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Choose a fruit</h1>

<input list="fruits" name="fruit" id="fruit">
<datalist id="fruits">
  <option value="Apple">
  <option value="Banana"> //id and list values are must same
  <option value="Orange">
  <option value="Mango">
  <option value="Grapes">
</datalist>

</body>
</html>


The <datalist> tag is especially useful when you want to provide suggestions to users but still allow them to input their own values. For example, in forms where users need to select a city, you can provide a list of popular cities but still allow them to type in a city that isnt on the list.

83. What is difference between HTML and XHTML?

. Strictness:
HTML is more flexible. You can skip some things like closing tags, and it still works.
XHTML is stricter. Every tag must be closed, and everything must be written in lowercase.
2. Error Handling:
In HTML, if you make a mistake, the browser will try to fix it and still show the page (but it might not look perfect).
In XHTML, if there's an error, the page won't show at all.
3. Tag Closure:
HTML doesnt always require you to close tags (like <img> or <br>).
XHTML requires closing tags for everything (e.g., <img /> and <br />).

What is the ‚Äòclass‚Äô attribute and id in HTML? 

class Attribute:
Purpose: The class attribute is used to group multiple elements together that share the same style or behavior.

Multiple Elements: You can assign the same class to many elements on the page.

Styling: It is typically used for applying CSS styles or targeting elements with JavaScript.


Using the same id for multiple elements in HTML can work, but it's not recommended because id is meant to be unique for each element. Here's why:

1. Uniqueness Requirement:
The id attribute is intended to identify a single unique element on the page. According to the HTML specification, id should be unique within a document.

JavaScript and CSS Behavior:
CSS: If you use the same id for multiple elements, CSS will still apply the styles to all those elements, but it will only properly target the last element with that id. This happens because CSS selectors expect ids to be unique, and the browser may prioritize the last id occurrence.

JavaScript: When you use JavaScript (e.g., document.getElementById()), it returns only the first element with the given id. This means that if you have multiple elements with the same id, JavaScript will only interact with the first one, and you could unintentionally miss the others.

85. What is the use of an IFrame tag?
IFrame or Inline Frame is basically an HTML document implanted inside the other  HTML documents on a website. The IFrame element is used for inserting content from other source, which can be an advertisement into a webpage


86. What is the use of figure tag in HTML 5?

87. Why is a URL encoded in HTML?
URL is encoded in HTML as it converts characters into a format that can be transmitted over the web. A URL is transmitted over the internet through the ASCII character set. The non-ASCII characters can be replaced by ‚Äú%‚Äù which is followed by hexadecimal digits.

Examples of ASCII Characters:
Letters: A, B, C, a, b, c
Numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3
Punctuation: !, ., ?, ,
Control Characters: \n, \t

Examples of Non-ASCII Characters:
Accented letters: √©, √ß, √±, √∂
Other languages: „ÅÇ„Çä„Åå„Å®„ÅÜ (Japanese), ‰Ω†Â•Ω (Chinese)
Special symbols: ¬©, ‚Ç¨, ‚Ñ¢
Emojis: üòä, ‚ù§Ô∏è



90. What is the advantage of collapsing white space?
White spaces are a sequence of blank space characters, treated as a single space character in an HTML document.

The advantages of collapsing white space are 
Helps the content of the code to be more understandable and readable to the users.  
Decreases the transmission time between the server and the client and removes unnecessary bytes that are occupied by the white spaces.
If you leave extra white space by mistake, the browser will ignore it and display the content properly.
